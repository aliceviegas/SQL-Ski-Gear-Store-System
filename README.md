## Overview
This project is a Ski Gear Shop Management System designed to streamline rental operations across three store locations. The system captures rental data across two ski seasons, manages inventory, and automates processes to improve efficiency.

## Features
- Multi-Store Support: Manage inventory and rental operations across three different locations.
- Rental Logging: Track all equipment rentals in a dedicated log table.
- Automated Processes: Reduce manual work with automated tracking and reporting.
- Inventory Management: Monitor stock levels of ski gear in real-time.
- Data-Driven Insights: Analyze rental trends across two ski seasons.

## Database Structure
The project utilizes a relational database with key tables such as:
- stores - Stores information about the three shop locations.
- equipment - Maintains a list of ski gear available for rent.
- customers - Stores customer details and rental history.
- rentals - Tracks each rental transaction, including timestamps and return status.
- log_table - Records system events and transactions for auditing purposes.
